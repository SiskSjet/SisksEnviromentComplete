Hey engineers,

this is my complete environment package with a dark sky box containing purple nebula.
I modified enviroment lighting so dark spots on planet, asteroids and ships should be darker.

Bloom is slightly reduced and instead of removing dirt on the screen, I reduced it and adjusted the color to the lense flares. Now it should be less annoying.

The sun is completely redone. The sun disk is a bit smaller, but with several custom beams in different colors. A light blue glow completes this.

In addition to the sun I create hexagon lense flares that fits nicely with the "dirt on screen".

**This Sky Box does not contain a Speed Mod.**

## Features

* Dark skybox with purple nebula in 4K
* Custom sun rays and lense flare
* Reduces and modified "screen dirt"
* Darker dark sides

## TODO

* Reduce glow from asteroids in direct sunlight without lowering `SunIntensity`
* Reduce or remove "colored atmospheric fog" between dark and lighten side of planets
